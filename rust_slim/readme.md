## Rust Slim - Slim server for Rust

Develop Slim Fixtures for rust applications. Based on the [Slim Protocol](http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.SliM.SlimProtocol) of fitnesse [http://fitnesse.org/FrontPage](http://fitnesse.org/FrontPage).

This is not 100% compliant with the slim protocol right now. It can only handle string symbols and it cannot use the STDOUT to comunicate. Only TCP comunication is supported. It can handle actors as well.

This is currently in an unstable version. The general API can change in the next versions.
